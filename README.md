# Practice_Command_Prompts
This is a review for Command Prompts being used on GitLab for Bootcamp

This is a test to see if I can push new material to GitHub
I hope it works this time.

I will be using the new notes I created on my Amazon Scribe.

Success

If you forget to PULL or PUSH files to GitHub
Please read the instructions you wrote on your Amazon Scribe.
Thank you!
